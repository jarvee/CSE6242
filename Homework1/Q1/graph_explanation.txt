I choose the Force Atlas as my layout algorithm because I think the graph.csv data emphasize the complementarities of the PoloChau's network systems. In my graph, PoloChau is the central of the network system. His friends and their friends' follower's are small groups, which connected to PoloChau. For each group, the big central represents the PoloChau's primary friends. And primary friends' friends or followers are the small cycles around the big one. I used different color notation by modularity of the network to notate different groups. All names are labels in my graph.
