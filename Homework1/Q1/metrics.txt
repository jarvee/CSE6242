Average Node Degree = 1.049
The average node degree indicates that the number of relation of the edges. Here, I think most of the persons has one friend or follower.

Diameter of the graph = 5
The diameter of the graph indicates the maximum distances between all pairs of the nodes. Here, I think the longest graph distance between any two nodes in the network is 5.

Average Path Length = 2.9536364118614395
